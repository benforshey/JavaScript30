    // note: The above are immutable data structures. When you reassign the value of a variable, you destroy and create anew.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Ben'
    // console.log(team, players)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy (slice) instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()  // Copy
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)  // Copy

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // or map
    const team5 = players.map(player => player)  // Copy

    // or Array.from()
    const team6 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[2] = 'Susi'
    team3[1] = 'Gracie'
    team4[0] = 'Violet'
    team5[0] = 'Violet'
    team5[1] = 'Gracie'
    team5[2] = 'Miles'
    team5[3] = 'Susi'
    team5[4] = 'Ben'

    console.log(team, team2, team3, team4, team5)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Ben',
      age: 32,
      social: {
        twitter: '@benforshey',
        facebook: 'benforshey'
      }
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // note: he uses Object.assign() here...

    // Poor man's deep clone. Converting to string breaks all mutability away. Has nasty side effects of converting date to UTC (ISO8601) & keys that have method literals (function values).
    const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
